		<h2>About our family</h2>
		<p> Our family is awesome! There are 5 humans, Mom, dad, elder sister Jen, Brother Navi, and younger sister Sen. Then there is this crazy clan, Pluto, the rambunctious dog, Timmy, the smarty pants aka a professor cat! and the sleepy head, Pumpkin. </p>
		
		<h3>How we joined the family</h3>
		<p> Pumpkin is the first one to join the family. He was a little baby back then, arrived in a board box, with dad and Jen. He still is a baby and never "grew up".
			<p>Timmy was adopted from a friend of dad. The day she arrived is unforgotten. She was fierce and frightened. hid in the basement for the entire night, Then slowly came out, and slowly stole our hearts, all of them and whole of them! </p>
			<p>Last one to join was Pluto, yet the one to dominate the house and neighbourhood too.</p>

		<P>Hey! it is me, Pluto. I Love every one in my family but dad is my best friend. I love to know what every one is doing and check them often. Going for walks with my dad is my favourite. And also love hangout with Jen and my mom because they give lots of hugs and kisses. I sleep on my brother's bed when he is in school! I hope he won't read this!</P>
