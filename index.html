		<h2>About our family</h2>
		<p> Our family is awesome! There are 5 humans, Mom, dad, elder sister Jen, Brother Navi, and younger sister Sen. Then there is this crazy clan, Pluto, the rambunctious dog, Timmy, the smarty pants a.k.a. a professor cat! and the sleepy head, Pumpkin. </p>
		
		<h3>How we joined the family</h3>
		<p> Pumpkin is the first one to join the family. He was a little baby back then, arrived in a board box, with dad and Jen. He still is a baby and never "grew up".
	    Timmy was adopted from a friend of dad. The day she arrived is unforgotten. She was fierce and frightened. hid in the basement for the entire night, Then slowly came out, and slowly stole our hearts, all of them and whole of them!
		Last one to join was Pluto, yet the one to dominate the house and neighbourhood too.</p>

		<P>Hey! it is me, Pluto. I Love every one in my family but dad is my best friend. I check every one in my family often to see  what they are doing and also to make sure they are okay. Going for walks with my dad is my favourite. And also love to hangout with Jen and my mom because they give lots of hugs and kisses. I sleep on my brother's bed when he is in school! I hope he won't read this! My favorite moment of the day is the time when dad comes home from work! That is when my heart explodes!</P>

		<p> Hello!, I am Timmy. The fiesty one! I have a routine. In the morning I have to go out. There are so many fun things happening out side. Sunlight!, little birds, trees, flowers in my mom's garden etc, so many cool things. I like to think a lot by the windowsil. Every one thinks that I am smart! My mom says that If I were born as a human I would be a professor or an astronaut!</p>

		<p> Hi I am Pumkin, an orange cat. I dont like other orange cats. I believe there should be only one orange cat in this world and that should be me! So I chase them and get into troubles. Therefore my mom doesnt let me go out!
		My sister gives me baths every weekend because I get easily messy. Everyone thinks that I am still a kitten.</p>
