		<h2>About our family</h2>
		<p> Our family is awesome! There are 5 humans, Mom, dad, elder sister Jen, brother Navi, and younger sister Sen. Then there is us,the crazy clan, Pluto, the rambunctious dog, Timmy, the smarty pants a.k.a. professor cat! and the sleepy head, Pumpkin. </p>
		
		<h3>How we joined the family</h3>
		<p> Pumpkin is the first one to join the family. He was a little baby back then, arrived in a board box, with dad and 2 sisters. He still is a baby and never "grew up".
	    Timmy was adopted from a friend of dad. She was already 2 years back then, the day she arrived will never be forgotten. She was fierce and frightened and hid in the basement entire night. Then she slowly came out, cautious at first but became very friendly. She slowly stole our hearts, all of them and whole of them!
		Last one to join was Pluto, Dad got him from one of his friends, a cute little puppy he was, with bright black eyes.</p>

		<h5> PLUTO</h5>
		<P>Hey! it is me, Pluto. I Love every one in my family but dad is my best friend. I check every one in my family often to see  what they are doing and also to make sure they are okay. Going for walks with my dad is my favourite. And also love to hangout with Jen and my mom because they give lots of hugs and kisses. I sleep on my brother's bed when he is in school! I hope he won't read this! My favorite moment of the day is the time when dad comes home from work! That is when my heart explodes!</P>

		<h6>TIMMY</h6>
		<p> Hello!, I am Timmy. The fiesty one! I have a routine. In the morning I would like to go out and check around the neighbourhood. There are so many fun things happening outside. Sunlight!, little birds, trees, flowers in my mom's garden, cool breeze. I like to think a lot sitting by the windowsil. Every one thinks that I am smart! My mom says that If I were born as a human I would be a professor or an astronaut!</p>

	<h5>PUMPKIN</h5>
		<p> Hi I am Pumkin, an orange cat. I dont like other orange cats. I believe there should be only one orange cat in this world and that should be me! So I chase them and get into troubles. Therefore my mom doesnt let me go out!
		My sister gives me baths every weekend because I get easily messy. Everyone thinks that I am still a kitten.</p>
